Apparently sometimes the letter case isn't set to upper upon entry

After choosing a dictionary, the selection should persist rather
than going back to `default'

Need an option to send the results to a memo

Requested: an option to run the same query against a different dictionary
(can be done already but they want a shortcut from the Word form to
pop up the dict list and then run the query).

Regular expression support

Simplified variable input
