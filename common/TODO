Try to find the Scrabble tournament dictionary.

Document common probs/known bugs.

Try to:

Find why it crashes the system if both PW++ and PWPro are installed (if 
it still does)

Beta test.

Package and upload.

=========

Clean up the Main Form layout - move Word Lengths and Counts back to two lines, create some 
more shortcut boxes at the bottom for Regexp chars, and remove the Dictionary trigger. Make
the dictionary selection work from the Menu instead (and maybe add a menu option to see
info about the current dictionary; full name, size, creation date, etc).

Then use the space freed by the dictionary line to create a RegExp text field, Clear button
and History popup, and implement these. Rename the Pattern field `Template'.
