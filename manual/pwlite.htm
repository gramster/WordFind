<p><b><font size=+2>0. Release Information</font></b>
<p>This document describes WordFindLite v1.1.&nbsp; WordFindLite v1.1 uses
the same underlying search engine as WordFind++ v2.4.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>1. Introduction</font></b>
<p>WordFindLite is a fast and powerful dictionary searching program for
use with word games like Scrabble and for crosswords, and codewords/cryptograms.
You can use it to generate lists of anagrams or to find word matches given
a subset of known letters.
<p>WordFindLite is a simplified version of the WordFind++ and WordFindPro
programs. It does not support the advanced features of these programs,
but has a simpler interface which makes it easier to use for the casual
user. It also does not have as many dictionary databases as the other programs,
nor include the dictionary builder (that comes with WordFindPro only).
<p>To use WordFindLite, you must also install one of the dictionary databases
it comes with for it to search.
<p>The currently available dictionaries are:
<p><b>demo.pdb</b> - the dictionary that comes with the trial versions
of WordFindLite, WordFind++ and WordFindPro, this has 30,240 words, of
up to 9 letters in length.
<p><b>ospd3.pdb</b> - for Scrabble players, this dictionary is made from
the OSPD3 word list of&nbsp; 116,887 words of up to 13 characters in length.
<p><b>small.pdb</b> - a crossword dictionary of 52,033 common words.
<p><b>medium.pdb</b> - a medium sized crossword dictionary of 133,426 words.
<p>The trial versions may be used with the <b>demo.pdb</b> dictionary only.
Unauthorised redistribution of the other dictionary database files is not
permitted.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>2. Using WordFindLite</font></b>
<p><b><font size=+1>General Crossword Help</font></b>
<p>For help with a crossword word, where only some letters are known:
<ul>
<li>
make sure the button at the bottom right is set to "Anchored"</li>

<li>
enter the word or words in the Template field. For positions where the
letter is unknown, press the "?" button. For multi-word clues, use the
"|" button to indicate word breaks.</li>

<li>
tap on the "Go!" button to start the search</li>
</ul>
For example, if you have a four letter clue with word lengths 2,4,2,4 and
you know the first letter of each word, you would enter the pattern "A?|G???|A?|G???".
<p>(In this case, the cryptic clue is "Behaviour deserving top trophy",
and the answer is "As good as gold").
<p><b><font size=+1>Finding Anagrams</font></b>
<p>To find anagrams, you need to enter the letters in the Anagram field.
For multi-word anagrams, use the "|" character as before to mark specific
positions as word breaks (as in a crossword anagram clue). For example,
if you had a crossword clue "Wicked television arrangement (4,3,3)" which
you guessed was an anagram of "television", you could enter "tele|vis|ion"
to find all possible matches. (The answer, in this case, is "evil ion set").
<p><b><font size=+1>The User Interface</font></b>
<p>The Main Form in WordFindLite looks like:
<p><img SRC="mainlite.jpg" height=160 width=160 align=ABSCENTER>
<p>There is a keyboard that you can use to enter letters, shortcut buttons
for the unknown letter indicator `?' and word separator `|', the `Go' button
to start a search, `Clear' buttons to clear the current pattern, and two
fields for entering patterns, one for template patterns and one for anagram
patterns.
<p>After pressing Go! in the Main Form, WordFindLite will display the matches
found in the Word Form, shown below.
<p><img SRC="wordlite.jpg" height=160 width=160 align=ABSCENTER>&nbsp;
The Word Form, displaying the partial results of a pattern search.
<p>The controls in the Word Form are:
<ul>
<li>
Next - show the next screenfull of matches</li>

<li>
Redo - start displaying the matches again from the first screen</li>

<li>
New - go back to the Main Form to start a new search</li>

<br>Stop! - while WordFindLite is busy searching for matches, you can press
this button to abort the search.</ul>
Note that the words shown are broken at the third character position, rather
than at the the fourth position, while the search pattern is broken at
the fourth position. This is due to a subtle difference between the anagram
and template style searches. If you insert word breaks in the anagram field,
this tells WordFindLite the lengths of the allowable matches, but does
not enforce the position of the break. That is, the anagram search pattern
"teac|her" tells WordFindLite to find two-word anagrams of the letters
"teacher" where one word is four letters long and the other is three letters
long.
<p>Entering a word break in the template field, however, fixes its position.
You can combine the two. For example, if you entered "????|???" in the
template field, and "teacher" in the anagram field, then WordFindLite would
find two-word anagrams of "teacher" where the first word is four letters
long and the second word is three letters long.
<p><b><font size=+2>3. Registration</font></b>
<p>WordFindLite is shareware, and cost US$8. The trial version can be used
with the demo.pdb dictionary for 21 days for evaluation purposes. If you
continue to use the program after that, you must pay for it. The full version
can be purchased and downloaded from PalmGear Headquarters at http://www.palmgear.com.
Registered users get access to other dictionaries, to future updates, and
to e-mail support.
<p>Before purchasing WordFindLite, I recommend that you try WordFind++
and WordFindPro. They offer considerably more powerful search types, although
they are somewhat more complicated to use. You may find that they suit
your requirements better. WordFindLite has been designed to support the
most common types of word searches, with the simplest possible interface.
WordFind++ supports much more powerful searches, but has a more complex
interface. WordFindPro supports even more types of searches, such as cryptogram
style searches (using numbers in place of letters), and UNIX regular-expression
style searches. It also allows you to search more than one dictionary,
and includes an MS-Windows program for creating your own dictionaries.

<p>While every endeavour has been made to eliminate bugs in this software,
the software is provided "as is", and the author makes no warranties as

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>5. Known Bugs/Limitations/Common Problems</font></b>
<p>There are no known bugs in this release.
<p>There are some limitations. Search patterns are restricted to 63 characters,
while words are restricted to 31.
<p>From questions I get asked by e-mail, I think I should just stress one
point:
<p>You must load a dictionary .pdb file or WordFindLite will just show
a "No dictionary!" error when you try to search.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>6. Version History</font></b>
<p>Changed the name from PalmWordLite to WordFindLite to avoid trademark
and copyright issues with Palm, Inc.
<p>Release 1.1 is built using an updated C++ application framework library.
This framework will be described in an article in Dr Dobbs Journal in late
2001, for those who are interested. There are very few functional changes,
except that previously WordFindLite would report a `no dictionary loaded'
error in response to an invalid search pattern; this has been corrected
and it will now distinguish between being unable to perform a search due
to the absence of a dictionary, and being unable to perform a search due
to an error in the search expression.
<p>Release 1.1 is built using PalmOS SDK 3.5 and requires PalmOS 3.1 at
the minimum.
